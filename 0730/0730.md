## `select` 문

* 문자 처리

```mariadb
-- SELECT 문
/*
	CRUD
	READ : SELECT
*/
	 
SELECT * from emp;
SELECT empno, empname, salary FROM emp;
SELECT empno as no, empname as name, salary FROM emp;
SELECT deptno, manager, empno | empname FROM emp;
SELECT empname, salary, salary/12 FROM emp;
SELECT empname, salary, round(salary/12,2) FROM emp;
```

ㄴ 함수문 사용 가능

* 날짜 처리

```mariadb
SELECT empname, hdate FROM emp;
SELECT empname, STR_to_DATE(hdate,'%Y') FROM emp;
```

* 조건 부여 `WHERE`

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > 3000 AND salary < 4000;
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary between 3500 AND 4000;
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empname = '이말숙';
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno in ('10', '20');
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empname like '%자%';
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empname like '__자%';
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE hdate > '2000-01-01';

```

* 정렬 `ORDER BY`

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary ASC;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY 5;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY 2, 5;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY deptno, salary;
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY deptno DESC, salary ASC;
```

* 중복

```mariadb
SELECT DISTINCT(deptno) FROM emp;
```

* 범위 설정

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;
```

* 여러 조건

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp 
WHERE hdate > '2000-01-01' 
AND empname like '김%'
AND empname like '홍%'
ORDER BY salary;
```

ㄴ 이렇게 되면 오류가 남.

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp 
WHERE hdate > '2000-01-01' 
AND empname like '김%'
OR empname like '홍%'
ORDER BY salary;
```

ㄴ 이렇게 되면 날짜 조건이 김씨에게만...

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp 
WHERE hdate > '2000-01-01' 
AND (empname like '김%'
OR empname like '홍%')
ORDER BY salary;
```

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM emp
WHERE hdate >'2000';
```

ㄴ 이렇게 해도 오류

```mariadb
SELECT empname, DATE_FORMAT(hdate,'%Y') FROM emp
WHERE hdate >'2000';
```

```mariadb
SELECT empname, DATE_FORMAT(hdate,'%Y') AS YEAR FROM emp
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(hdate, '%Y') >= '2000';
```

```mariadb
SELECT empname, DATE_FORMAT(hdate,'%Y') AS YEAR, salary, 
ROUND(salary/12, 0) AS msalary 
FROM emp
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(hdate, '%Y') >= '2000';
```

* `GROUP BY`

```mariadb
SELECT empno, empname, ROUND(salary/12,2),
		DATE_FORMAT(hdate, '%Y')FROM emp
WHERE empno IN ('1001','1002', '1003')
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

```mariadb
SELECT deptno, SUM(salary), ROUND(AVG(salary),1) FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
```

```mariadb
# 부서별 월급의 합과,,,,
SELECT deptno,
	SUM(salary), 
	ROUND(AVG(salary),1),
	COUNT(*),
	STDDEV(salary),
	VAR_SAMP(salary),
	MIN(salary),
	MAX(salary)
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
```

* `WHERE`대신 `HAVING`

```mariadb
SELECT deptno,
	SUM(salary), 
	ROUND(AVG(salary),1),
	COUNT(*),
	STDDEV(salary),
	VAR_SAMP(salary),
	MIN(salary),
	MAX(salary)
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING SUM(salary) >= 10000
```

* `ORDER BY`추가

```mariadb
SELECT deptno,
	SUM(salary), 
	ROUND(AVG(salary),1),
	COUNT(*),
	STDDEV(salary),
	VAR_SAMP(salary),
	MIN(salary),
	MAX(salary)
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING SUM(salary) >= 10000
ORDER BY SUM(salary) DESC
```
